# Postman collection for Typesense

Calling Typesense API via `curl` commands on your terminal can be a bit cumbersome.

Thankfully, we've put together a <a href="https://www.postman.com/typesense/workspace/typesense-api/overview">Postman collection</a> that you can use and share with your team. We'll also be happy to accept any changes or improvements -- send us a PR!

There are two methods you can use our postman collection. One is from the postman public API directory and other is just download the json from this Github repository and import it to your postman. We have shared the steps below for both the methods.

# Method - 1 - Importing from postman public API directory
Navigate to this <a href="typesense.postman_collection.json" download="https://www.postman.com/typesense/workspace/typesense-api/overview">Postman collection</a>, login into your postman click on typesense on to the left and select fork. Forking creates a copy of the collection in your account.

Give it a name and the workspace to which you want to import it.
